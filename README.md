Natal is a simple command-line utility that automates most of the process of
setting up a React Native app running on ClojureScript.

It stands firmly on the shoulders of giants, specifically those of
[Mike Fikes](http://blog.fikesfarm.com) who created
[Ambly](https://github.com/omcljs/ambly) and the
[documentation](https://github.com/omcljs/ambly/wiki/ClojureScript-React-Native-Quick-Start)
on setting up a ClojureScript React Native app.
